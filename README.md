# Arduino Playground

This repository contains some experiments that I made when playing with my Arduino Leonardo and some basic components (potentiometer, button, rotary encoder).

I keep all of my experiments here for my future self.

## Schematics

Just in case I forgot everything, I've included schematics for each of my experiments, as an image, but I also attached the Fritzing file as well. [Frizing](http://www.fritzing.org/) is an open source hardware initiative, and they made a really nice and [open source software](https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app) to create electronic schematics.
